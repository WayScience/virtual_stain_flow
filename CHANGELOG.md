## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-07

### Added

#### Dataset Infrastructure Refactoring (`datasets`)
- Introduced a comprehensive refactoring of the dataset infrastructure for improved modularity, lazy loading, and memory efficiency.

##### Core Components:
- **`DatasetManifest`** (`manifest.py`): Immutable manifest class that defines the structure of a dataset, holding a file index DataFrame where each row corresponds to a sample/FOV and columns represent channels. Validates file paths and PIL image modes during initialization.
- **`IndexState`** (`manifest.py`): Lightweight tracker for maintaining the last accessed dataset index.
- **`FileState`** (`manifest.py`): Lazy loading backend that manages image loading with configurable LRU caching. 
- **`BaseImageDataset`** (`base_dataset.py`): PyTorch-compatible dataset class built on the manifest infrastructure. 

### Refactored
- Restructured dataset loading logic to use the new modular manifest-based architecture.
- Improved error handling and validation throughout the dataset pipeline.
- Enhanced type annotations and documentation for better developer experience.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08

### Added

#### New modular backbone for `models` subpackage
##### Major changes:
- Introduced a new modular and extensible `models` subpackage for building image-to-image translation models. 
The subpackage is designed around a declarative style for creating U-Net-like architectures, with a hierarchy of abstractions:
  - **Blocks** (`blocks.py`, `up_down_blocks.py`): Smallest modular units, categorized into computational blocks (e.g., `Conv2DNormActBlock`, `Conv2DConvNeXtBlock`) and spatial dimension altering blocks (e.g., `Conv2DDownBlock`, `PixelShuffle2DUpBlock`).
  - **Stages** (`stages.py`): Sequences of blocks for downsampling or upsampling, such as `DownStage` and `UpStage`.
  - **Encoder** (`encoder.py`): Implements the downsampling path of U-Net-like architectures using `DownStage` objects.
  - **Decoder** (`decoder.py`): Implements the upsampling path with skip connections using `UpStage` objects.
  - **BaseModel** and **BaseGeneratorModel** (`model.py`): Added abstract base classes for models, including functionality for saving weights, configuration handling, and defining the forward pass.
  - **UNet** (`unet.py`): Predefined model class supporting fully convolutional and maxpooling-based U-Net variants.
  - **UNeXt** (`unext.py`): Predefined U-Net variant with a ConvNeXtV2_tiny encoder and customizable decoder.
- Added utility functions for normalization layers, activation functions, and type checking of block handles and configurations.
- Refer to the `models` README for detailed explanations of components and usage examples.

### Refactored 

#### Repository Restructuring
- Restructured the repository from a flat layout to the conventional `/src/package_name/` structure. 
This change improves module discoverability, aligns with modern Python packaging standards, and reduces potential import conflicts. 
All package-related code now resides under the `src/virtual_stain_flow/` directory.
- Updated import paths throughout the codebase to reflect the new structure.
- Adjusted setup scripts and documentation to accommodate the restructuring.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-19

### Added

#### Overhaul Phase 1/? - Logging Framework Overhaul
A minimal rework of the logging framework as the first step to a complete overhual of the `virtual_stain_flow` software. 

This version defines a new logging subpackage that better integrates MLflow into the virtual staining model training process for a more comprehensive logging framework.

#### Introduced `logging.MlflowLogger` class
Notes: This class is simiar to the old `virtual_stain_flow.callback.MlflowLogger` class, but promoted to be an independent logger class, with ability to accept logger callbacks. Key design/functionality:
- Files/metrics/parameters produced by Logger callbacks gets automatically logged to MLflow appropriately instead of being independent products untracked. 
- Included some more pre-defined fine-grained run logging tags such as `experiment_type`, `model_architecture`, `target_channel_name`, `description` as logger class parameter.
- Has a `bind_trainer` and `unbind_trainer` methods to bind and unbind with the trainer instance during train step. 
- User controlled mlflow run cycle, no longer autoamtically ends with the train loop, so user can perform additional logging operation before explicity ending the run.
- Has exposed `log_artifact`, `log_metric`, and `log_param` methods for manual logging of artifacts, metrics, and parameters.
- Has some access point of trainer attributes for use by logger callbacks, but subject to optimization/change.

#### Introduced `trainers.trainerAbstractLoggingTrainer` class
Notes: This class subclasses the `virtual_stain_flow.trainers.AbstractTrainer` class and preserves most of its behavior and functionalities. 
Design/functionality change include:
- Binding of logger class moved from initialization to `train` method to reflect the design that logger instances should live with the training sessions.
- Early termination mode is now a parameter of the class to allow for selection of min/max optimzation mode.
- The `train` method loop invokes the logger life cycle methods:
    - `logger.on_train_start()`
    - `logger.on_epoch_start()`
    - `logger.on_epoch_end()`
    - `logger.on_train_end()` methods which in turn leads to logger's invocation of the logger callback methods.
- Requires child classes to implement the @abstract `save_model` method for unified handle for saving model weights that can be called by the logger.

#### Introduced `trainers.LoggingTrainer` class
Notes: This class is nearly identical to the old Trainer class, except that:
- It is the realization of the new `AbstractLoggingTrainer` class instead of the `AbstractTrainer` class.
- It overrides the parent class `save_model` method that defines saving of the model weight.

#### Introduced `logging.callbacks` subpackage
Notes: This is a new subpackage that is distinct from the existing `virtual_stain_flow.callbacks` 
subpackage in that classes under this subpackage are passed to `logging.MlflowLogger` instances as 
opposed to a `trainers.*` instances.     

##### The subpackage currently contains:
- `AbstractLoggerCallback` class: A newly introduced abstract class that defines behavior for logger
callbacks interacting with the `logging.MlflowLogger` class so product of callback gets logged appropriately as artifacts/metrics/parameters.
- `PlotPredictionCallback` class: A newly introduced class that is a realization of the `AbstractLoggerCallback` class. Serves as an example implementation of a logger callback. Similar to the `virtual_stain_flow.callbacks.intermediatePlotCallback`, plots predictions of the model on a subset of the dataset, but the additional interface with the `MlflowLogger` class ensures the 
plots produced are logged as mlflow artifacts.

### Refactored
- Internal function renames for clarity.
- Consistent attribute/property usage.
- Updated `__init__.py` directly exposing classes under subpackage.
