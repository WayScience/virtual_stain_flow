blocks.py

Following the conventions of timm.model.convnext 
(https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/models/convnext.py), 
we define a block as the smallest modular unit in image-image translation model,
taking in a feature map tensor of shape (B, C, H, W) and returning a 
feature map tensor of shape (B, C', H', W') where the number of
channels C' and spatial dimensions (H', W') is determined by the block's
implementation.

Here we further make the distinction between "computational blocks"  (this file) 
and "spatial dimension altering blocks", where the former does not change
the spatial dimensions of the input tensor, but may change the number of channels,
while the latter does change the spatial dimensions.

This file Contains the definition of the AbstractBlock class defining the 
behavior of a "block" and centralizing type check for Type[AbstractBlock]
during runtime.
Also contains the implementation of the spatial dimension preserving 
"computational blocks" that learns from feature map tensors at a specific
resolution to capture the context and local features of the images. This is
commonly achieved by applying dimension preserving convolutional layers
with kernel > 1 (usually 3), as in F/UNet architectures.
