"""
The Decoder class implements the upsampling path of a U-Net style
image-image translation model. It is designed to work with feature maps
from an encoder, allowing for flexible configurations of the input and
computation blocks at each stage.

The decoder stages are constructed based on the channels of the encoder's
feature maps, with each stage performing upsampling and concatenation
with skip connections from the corresponding encoder stage.
