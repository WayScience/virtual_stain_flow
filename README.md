# `virtual_stain_flow` - For developing virtual staining models

## Overview
`virtual_stain_flow` is a framework for the reproducible development and training of image-to-image translation models that enable virtual staining (the prediction of "virtual" stains) from label-free microscopy images.  
The package provides comprehensive experiment tracking that spans the entire model development workflow, from dataset construction, augmentation, model customization to training.

## Supported Model Architectures

- **U-Net** – A classical encoder–decoder architecture with skip connections.  
  This lightweight design has been widely used for virtual staining tasks, as demonstrated by [Ounkomol et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0111-2).

- **wGAN-GP** – A Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty.  
  This generative adversarial setup combines a U-Net generator with a convolutional discriminator regularized via gradient penalty for stable training.  
  As shown by [Cross-Zamirski et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12914-x), adversarial training enhances the realism of synthetic stains.

- **ConvNeXt-UNet** – A fully convolutional architecture inspired by recent computer vision advances.  
  Drawing from [Liu et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.03545) and [Liu et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-025-01046-2), this variant incorporates transformer-like architectural refinements to improve the fidelity of virtual staining details, at the cost of higher computational demand.
